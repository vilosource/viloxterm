# Architecture Refactor Retrospective

## What Went Wrong

### 1. **Parallel Model Problem**
**Issue**: We created a new clean model (WorkspaceModelImpl) but didn't fully migrate from the old model (SplitPaneModel).

**Result**: Two models existed simultaneously:
- WorkspaceModelImpl (empty, used by commands)
- SplitPaneModel (had actual state, used by UI)

**Impact**: Split commands failed with "No active pane" because they queried the empty model.

### 2. **State Restoration Oversight**
**Issue**: When implementing the new architecture, we focused on runtime operations but missed the startup/restoration flow.

**Result**:
- UI continued creating widgets directly during state restoration
- Model remained empty after app startup
- Commands couldn't operate on non-existent model state

### 3. **Incomplete Migration**
**Issue**: We didn't fully convert SplitPaneWidget to use the new model.

**Result**:
- SplitPaneWidget still had its own SplitPaneModel
- Created a third layer of state management
- Increased complexity instead of reducing it

### 4. **Bridge Components Not Initially Recognized**
**Issue**: We tried to enforce strict layer separation without recognizing legitimate cross-layer dependencies.

**Result**:
- terminal_server circular import issue
- Had to implement lazy loading as a workaround
- Eventually recognized it as a "bridge component"

### 5. **Testing Gap**
**Issue**: We didn't test the full user journey after each phase.

**Result**:
- Split functionality appeared to work in isolation
- Failed in real usage due to empty model
- Discovered issue late in the process

## What We Learned

### 1. **State Management is Critical**
- **Lesson**: State initialization and restoration must be considered from the start
- **Takeaway**: Always trace the full lifecycle: startup → runtime → shutdown

### 2. **Incremental Migration Needs Clear Boundaries**
- **Lesson**: Having two models temporarily is OK, but they must be clearly delineated
- **Takeaway**: Mark legacy code clearly, have a migration plan for each component

### 3. **Bridge Components are Legitimate**
- **Lesson**: Not all cross-layer dependencies are bad
- **Takeaway**: Identify and document bridge components early, don't fight the architecture

### 4. **Observer Pattern Requires Complete Implementation**
- **Lesson**: Observers are only useful if someone is listening
- **Takeaway**: When adding observer pattern, immediately connect observers and verify events flow

### 5. **Model-First Approach is Powerful**
- **Lesson**: Routing everything through the model provides consistency
- **Takeaway**: UI should never create state directly, always react to model changes

## What We Missed

### 1. **Complete Model Migration**
We still have split responsibilities:
- WorkspaceModelImpl handles tabs and high-level panes
- SplitPaneModel handles the actual split tree structure
- Need to unify these into a single model

### 2. **Widget Lifecycle Management**
Currently unclear who owns AppWidgets:
- Created by SplitPaneModel
- Referenced by PaneState
- Displayed by SplitPaneWidget
- Need clear ownership model

### 3. **Plugin System Integration**
The model changes weren't fully integrated with plugins:
- Plugins might still use old patterns
- Need to update SDK to work with new model
- Plugin events need to flow through model

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
Missing test coverage for:
- State restoration flow
- Model-UI synchronization
- Command execution on restored state
- Multi-tab scenarios

### 5. **Performance Considerations**
We didn't measure:
- Observer notification overhead
- Model update performance with many panes
- Memory usage with duplicate state

## Remaining Architecture Issues

### 1. **Dual Model Problem**
- SplitPaneModel still exists and manages tree structure
- WorkspaceModelImpl only has flat pane list
- Need to merge tree management into WorkspaceModelImpl

### 2. **State Synchronization**
- UI state saved separately from model state
- Potential for desync between saves
- Need single source for persistence

### 3. **Event Flow Complexity**
Multiple event systems:
- Qt signals/slots
- Model observers
- Event bus
- Service events
Need to consolidate or clearly separate concerns

### 4. **Widget Registry Confusion**
Multiple registries:
- AppWidgetManager (global)
- widget_registry (legacy)
- WorkspaceWidgetRegistry (in service)
Need single registry with clear purpose

### 5. **Command Context**
Commands don't have access to:
- Current widget state
- UI context (focused widget)
- Model context consistently
Need better context management

## Recommendations Going Forward

### Phase 1: Complete Model Unification
1. Merge SplitPaneModel tree logic into WorkspaceModelImpl
2. Make PaneState own the tree structure
3. Remove SplitPaneModel entirely

### Phase 2: Clarify Widget Ownership
1. Model owns widget IDs and state
2. AppWidgetManager owns widget instances
3. UI only displays widgets

### Phase 3: Simplify Event Systems
1. Model events for state changes
2. Qt signals for UI interactions
3. Event bus for cross-cutting concerns
4. Remove service events

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing
1. Add integration tests for state restoration
2. Test command execution on various states
3. Performance benchmarks for model operations
4. Plugin compatibility tests

### Phase 5: Documentation
1. Document the final architecture
2. Create migration guide for plugins
3. Add architecture decision records (ADRs)
4. Update developer documentation

## Success Metrics

To validate the refactor is complete:

1. **Functional**: All commands work after state restoration
2. **Performance**: Operations complete in <10ms
3. **Clarity**: New developers understand architecture in <1 hour
4. **Maintainability**: Changes require touching <3 files
5. **Testability**: 80% code coverage on model/service layers

## Key Insight

The biggest lesson: **Architecture refactoring must consider the entire system lifecycle**, not just the runtime behavior. State initialization, restoration, and persistence are as important as the runtime model.

The refactor succeeded in establishing clean patterns but failed initially because we didn't trace the complete data flow from disk → model → UI → commands.
