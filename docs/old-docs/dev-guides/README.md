# Developer Guides

This directory contains comprehensive developer guides for implementing and extending ViloxTerm functionality. These guides provide step-by-step instructions, best practices, and real-world examples based on lessons learned during development.

## Purpose

Developer guides bridge the gap between high-level architecture documentation and code implementation. They provide:
- **Practical tutorials** for common development tasks
- **Best practices** discovered through implementation
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them
- **Real examples** from the codebase
- **Troubleshooting tips** for typical issues
