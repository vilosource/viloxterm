## Architectural Strengths

### 1. Widget Architecture (★★★★☆)

**Pattern**: Abstract Factory + Object Pool

The `AppWidget` base class provides a solid foundation for different widget types:
- Clean inheritance hierarchy
- Widget pooling for performance
- Proper cleanup mechanisms
- Focus management support

**Example**:
```python
class AppWidget(QWidget):
    def cleanup(self)
    def focus_widget(self)
    def get_state(self)
    def set_state(self)
```

### 2. Split Pane System (★★★★★)

**Pattern**: Model-View + Binary Tree

Excellent separation of concerns:
- `SplitPaneModel`: Pure logic in binary tree structure
- `SplitPaneWidget`: Qt view implementation
- Clean state serialization/deserialization
- Recursive splitting support

This is the best-designed component in the system.

### 3. Signal/Slot Communication (★★★★☆)

**Pattern**: Observer

Proper use of Qt's signal/slot mechanism:
- Loose coupling between components
- Clear event flow
- Good signal naming conventions

### 4. State Persistence (★★★☆☆)

**Pattern**: Memento

Uses QSettings appropriately:
- Window geometry saved
- Workspace layout preserved
- Theme preferences retained

### 5. Terminal Integration (★★★☆☆)

**Pattern**: Bridge + Adapter

Good separation between Qt and web technologies:
- Flask server for terminal backend
- QWebEngine for rendering
- Bridge pattern for communication

## Architectural Weaknesses

### 1. Lack of Centralized Command System (Critical)

**Issue**: Actions are scattered and tightly coupled to UI elements

**Impact**:
- Difficult to add keyboard shortcuts
- No command discovery mechanism
- Cannot implement command palette efficiently
- Testing requires UI interaction

**Example of Current Approach**:
```python
# In main_window.py - shortcuts hardcoded in UI
new_editor_tab_action.setShortcut(QKeySequence("Ctrl+N"))
new_editor_tab_action.triggered.connect(lambda: self.workspace.add_editor_tab())
```

### 2. Missing Dependency Injection (Major)

**Issue**: Direct instantiation and singleton access patterns

**Impact**:
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to test in isolation
- Hard to swap implementations
- Global state issues

**Example**:
```python
# Direct singleton access
from ui.terminal.terminal_server import terminal_server
terminal_server.start_server()
```

### 3. Inconsistent MVC Implementation (Major)

**Issue**: MVC pattern partially implemented

**Where it works**:
- Split pane system (model/view separation)

**Where it doesn't**:
- Main window (controller logic mixed with view)
- Activity bar (no separate model)
- Workspace (business logic in UI)

### 4. No Service Layer (Major)

**Issue**: Business logic scattered across UI components

**Impact**:
- Difficult to reuse logic
- UI changes require logic changes
- No clear API boundaries

### 5. Limited Context Management (Major)

**Issue**: No systematic way to track application state/context

**Impact**:
- Cannot implement context-sensitive shortcuts
- Difficult to enable/disable commands based on state
- No "when" clause support for actions

### 6. Weak Controller Layer (Moderate)

**Issue**: Controllers directory exists but barely used

**Current state**:
- `state_controller.py` exists but minimal
- Most controller logic in UI components
- No clear controller responsibilities

### 7. Event Handling Scattered (Moderate)

**Issue**: Keyboard/mouse events handled ad-hoc

**Impact**:
- No central place to manage shortcuts
- Potential conflicts between shortcuts
- Difficult to implement vim-like modes

### 8. No Plugin/Extension Architecture (Minor)

**Issue**: All functionality built into core

**Impact**:
- Cannot add features dynamically
- No third-party extension support
- Monolithic growth over time

## Design Pattern Analysis

### Currently Used Patterns (Correctly)

1. **Observer Pattern**: Signal/slots
2. **Factory Pattern**: Widget creation
3. **Object Pool**: Widget recycling
4. **Singleton**: Terminal server, Icon manager
5. **Bridge**: Terminal web/Qt bridge
6. **Memento**: State serialization

### Missing Beneficial Patterns

1. **Command Pattern**: For actions/undo/redo
2. **Strategy Pattern**: For keymap schemes
3. **Chain of Responsibility**: For event handling
4. **Mediator**: For complex component interaction
5. **Repository Pattern**: For data access
6. **Service Locator**: For dependency management

## Component Coupling Analysis

### Tight Coupling Issues

1. **MainWindow ← → Everything**
   - Main window knows too much about internals
   - Direct widget manipulation

2. **Terminal ← → Flask Server**
   - Hard dependency on specific server
   - Cannot swap implementations

3. **Activity Bar ← → Sidebar**
   - Direct state manipulation
   - Should communicate through mediator

### Loose Coupling Successes

1. **SplitPaneModel ← → SplitPaneWidget**
   - Clean interface
   - Model independent of Qt

2. **AppWidget ← → Concrete Widgets**
   - Good abstraction
   - Polymorphic behavior

## Recommendations

2. **Virtual Rendering**: For large lists
3. **Worker Threads**: For heavy operations

## Security Considerations

### Current Issues

1. **Terminal Access**: Full system access
2. **No Sandboxing**: Unrestricted execution
3. **State Storage**: Unencrypted settings

### Recommendations

1. **Sandbox Terminal**: Restrict file access
2. **Validate Commands**: Input sanitization
3. **Encrypt Sensitive**: Settings encryption

## Conclusion

The ViloApp architecture has solid foundations in several areas, particularly the widget system and split pane implementation. However, it lacks the architectural patterns necessary for implementing advanced features like comprehensive keyboard support and command palette.

The most critical improvement needed is a centralized command system that decouples actions from UI elements. This will enable:
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- Command palette implementation
- Better testability
- Future plugin support

The recommended phased approach allows for incremental improvement without disrupting existing functionality. Priority should be given to implementing the command system and keyboard service, as these form the foundation for power-user features.

### Overall Architecture Score: 6.5/10

**Strengths**: Good widget design, clean split pane system, proper Qt usage
**Weaknesses**: No command system, scattered shortcuts, weak service layer
**Opportunity**: Command system implementation will significantly improve the architecture
