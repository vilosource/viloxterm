# Widget Lifecycle Architecture

## Overview

The Widget Lifecycle Architecture provides a robust, event-driven system for managing the complete lifecycle of application widgets (AppWidgets) in ViloxTerm. This architecture ensures proper initialization, state management, resource cleanup, and coordination between asynchronous widget operations and the UI framework.

## Core Concepts

### AppWidget

An AppWidget is the fundamental content unit in ViloxTerm - representing terminals, editors, file explorers, and other interactive components. Each AppWidget extends from a base class that provides lifecycle management capabilities.

### Widget States

The architecture defines seven distinct states that a widget can be in during its lifetime:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CREATED: Widget instantiated
    CREATED --> INITIALIZING: initialize()
    INITIALIZING --> READY: set_ready()
    INITIALIZING --> ERROR: set_error()
    READY --> SUSPENDED: suspend()
    SUSPENDED --> READY: resume()
    ERROR --> INITIALIZING: retry_initialization()
    READY --> DESTROYING: cleanup()
    SUSPENDED --> DESTROYING: cleanup()
    ERROR --> DESTROYING: cleanup()
    DESTROYING --> DESTROYED: cleanup complete
    DESTROYED --> [*]
```

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. State Machine Pattern

The widget lifecycle implements a formal state machine with validated transitions. Each state transition is validated against a predefined set of legal transitions, preventing invalid state changes and ensuring predictable behavior.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents race conditions
- Ensures predictable widget behavior
- Simplifies debugging through clear state tracking
- Enables proper resource management per state

### 2. Observer Pattern

The architecture extensively uses Qt's signal-slot mechanism (Observer pattern) to decouple components and enable event-driven behavior:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AppWidget] -->|widget_ready signal| B[SplitPaneWidget]
    A -->|widget_error signal| C[ErrorHandler]
    A -->|widget_state_changed signal| D[StateMonitor]
    A -->|focus_requested signal| E[FocusManager]
    B -->|connects to signal| F[Focus on Ready]
```

**Key Signals:**
- `widget_ready`: Emitted when async initialization completes
- `widget_error`: Emitted on initialization or runtime errors
- `widget_state_changed`: Emitted on any state transition
- `widget_destroying`: Emitted before cleanup begins
- `focus_requested`: Emitted when widget requests focus

### 3. Template Method Pattern

The base AppWidget class defines the lifecycle structure with hooks for subclasses to customize behavior:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AppWidget {
        +initialize()
        +set_ready()
        +set_error()
        +suspend()
        +resume()
        +cleanup()
        #on_suspend()
        #on_resume()
        #on_cleanup()
        #retry_initialization()
    }

    class TerminalAppWidget {
        #on_cleanup()
        #retry_initialization()
    }

    class EditorAppWidget {
        #on_suspend()
        #on_resume()
    }

    AppWidget <|-- TerminalAppWidget
    AppWidget <|-- EditorAppWidget
```

The base class provides the lifecycle framework while subclasses override specific hooks to implement their unique behavior.

### 4. Resource Management Pattern

The architecture includes automatic resource management through the SignalManager component:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Widget Created] --> B[SignalManager Created]
    B --> C[Signals Connected & Tracked]
    C --> D[Widget Active]
    D --> E[Widget Cleanup]
    E --> F[SignalManager.disconnect_all]
    F --> G[All Connections Removed]
    G --> H[Widget Destroyed]
```

This ensures no memory leaks from dangling signal connections.

## Lifecycle Flow

### Synchronous Widget Initialization

For simple widgets that don't require async operations:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SplitPane
    participant AppWidget
    participant UI

    User->>SplitPane: Split Pane
    SplitPane->>AppWidget: Create Widget
    AppWidget->>AppWidget: State: CREATED
    AppWidget->>AppWidget: initialize()
    AppWidget->>AppWidget: State: INITIALIZING
    AppWidget->>AppWidget: set_ready()
    AppWidget->>AppWidget: State: READY
    AppWidget-->>SplitPane: widget_ready signal
    SplitPane->>AppWidget: focus_widget()
    AppWidget->>UI: setFocus()
```

### Asynchronous Widget Initialization

For widgets requiring async operations (e.g., TerminalAppWidget):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SplitPane
    participant Terminal
    participant WebEngine
    participant Bridge

    User->>SplitPane: Split Pane (Ctrl+\)
    SplitPane->>Terminal: Create TerminalAppWidget
    Terminal->>Terminal: State: CREATED â†’ INITIALIZING
    Terminal->>WebEngine: Load terminal HTML
    SplitPane->>Terminal: focus_widget()
    Terminal->>Terminal: Queue focus (not ready)
    Note over Terminal: _pending_focus = True
    WebEngine-->>Terminal: loadFinished signal
    Terminal->>Terminal: set_ready()
    Terminal->>Terminal: State: READY
    Terminal-->>SplitPane: widget_ready signal
    Terminal->>Terminal: Process pending focus
    Terminal->>WebEngine: setFocus()
    Terminal->>Bridge: focus_terminal_element()
```

## Focus Management

The architecture implements intelligent focus management that respects widget readiness:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[focus_widget called] --> B{Widget State?}
    B -->|READY| C[Set Focus Immediately]
    B -->|INITIALIZING| D[Queue Focus Request]
    B -->|ERROR/DESTROYING| E[Reject Focus]
    D --> F[Widget becomes READY]
    F --> G[widget_ready signal]
    G --> H[Process Pending Focus]
    H --> C
```

### Focus Queue Mechanism

When focus is requested on a widget that isn't ready:
1. The request is queued internally (`_pending_focus = True`)
2. When the widget becomes ready, it processes the pending focus
3. This ensures focus is never lost due to timing issues

### Explicit Focus Tracking

The architecture provides explicit focus tracking through:
- **`has_focus` property**: Read-only property to check if widget has keyboard focus
- **`focusInEvent`/`focusOutEvent`**: Qt event handlers that update internal focus state
- **`_has_focus` field**: Internal tracking of focus state independent of Qt's hasFocus()

This explicit tracking is particularly useful in testing environments where Qt's focus behavior may differ.

## Signal Lifecycle Management

The SignalManager component provides automatic tracking and cleanup of Qt signal connections:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SignalManager {
        -owner: QObject
        -connections: List[SignalConnection]
        +connect(signal, slot, type, description, group)
        +disconnect(connection)
        +disconnect_all()
        +disconnect_group(group)
        +enable_group(group)
        +disable_group(group)
        +get_connection_count()
        +get_groups()
    }

    class SignalConnection {
        +signal: Any
        +slot: Any
        +connection_type: Qt.ConnectionType
        +description: str
        +group: Optional[str]
    }

    class AppWidget {
        -_signal_manager: SignalManager
    }

    SignalManager "1" --* "many" SignalConnection
    AppWidget --> SignalManager
```

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Signals are connected through SignalManager.connect()
2. **Tracking**: Each connection is tracked with metadata
3. **Grouping**: Connections can be organized into groups for bulk operations
4. **Cleanup**: On widget destruction, all connections are automatically disconnected
5. **Safety**: Prevents memory leaks and orphaned connections

### Connection Groups

SignalManager supports organizing connections into groups:
- **`disconnect_group(group)`**: Disconnect all connections in a group
- **`enable_group(group)`**: Reconnect all connections in a group
- **`disable_group(group)`**: Temporarily disconnect group without removing
- **`get_groups()`**: List all defined groups

This is useful for managing related signals together, such as all UI update signals or all data synchronization signals.

## Error Handling and Recovery

The architecture implements automatic error recovery with configurable retry strategy:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Widget Error] --> B[set_error]
    B --> C{Error Count < max_retries?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Schedule Retry]
    C -->|No| E[Stay in ERROR state]
    D --> F[Wait: base_delay * backoff_factor^(count-1)]
    F --> G[retry_initialization]
    G --> H[initialize]
```

### Configurable Retry Strategy

The retry mechanism can be customized per widget using `configure_retry_strategy()`:

- **`max_retries`**: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- **`base_delay`**: Initial retry delay in milliseconds (default: 1000ms)
- **`backoff_factor`**: Exponential backoff multiplier (default: 1.5)

Example configurations:
- Default: 3 retries with delays of 1000ms, 1500ms, 2250ms
- Aggressive: 5 retries with delays of 500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms, 4000ms, 8000ms (factor: 2.0)
- Disabled: 0 retries (no automatic recovery)

## Visibility Management

Widgets automatically suspend when hidden and resume when shown:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    READY --> SUSPENDED: hideEvent()
    SUSPENDED --> READY: showEvent()

    state SUSPENDED {
        [*] --> PausedOperations
        PausedOperations: Expensive operations paused
        PausedOperations: Resources minimized
    }

    state READY {
        [*] --> ActiveOperations
        ActiveOperations: Full functionality
        ActiveOperations: Resources active
    }
```

## Advanced Focus Management

The FocusManager provides sophisticated focus handling capabilities:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FocusManager {
        -_current_focus: str
        -_focus_history: deque
        -_focus_queue: List[FocusRequest]
        -_focus_groups: Dict
        -_focus_policies: Dict
        +request_focus(widget_id, priority)
        +restore_previous_focus()
        +cycle_focus(group, forward)
        +set_focus_policy(widget_id, policy)
    }

    class FocusRequest {
        +widget_id: str
        +priority: FocusPriority
        +callback: Optional[Callable]
        +reason: str
    }

    class FocusPriority {
        <<enumeration>>
        LOW
        NORMAL
        HIGH
        CRITICAL
    }

    FocusManager --> FocusRequest
    FocusRequest --> FocusPriority
```

### Focus Features

- **Priority Queue**: Focus requests are handled by priority
- **Focus History**: 50-entry history for navigation
- **Focus Groups**: Organize widgets for tab cycling
- **Focus Policies**: Fine-grained control over focus behavior
- **Focus Restoration**: Return focus to previous widget

## State Transition Callbacks

Widgets support custom callbacks for lifecycle events:

```python
# Register callbacks for specific transitions
widget.on_state_transition(
    from_state=WidgetState.INITIALIZING,
    to_state=WidgetState.READY,
    callback=lambda w, f, t: print(f"Widget {w.widget_id} is ready!")
)

# Register for any transition
widget.on_state_transition(
    callback=lambda w, f, t: log_transition(w, f, t)
)
```

This enables:
- Custom initialization completion handlers
- Error recovery hooks
- Resource management on state changes
- Testing and debugging hooks

## Widget Debugging Utilities

### WidgetDebugger

Comprehensive debugging support for widget lifecycle:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class WidgetDebugger {
        -_tracked_widgets: Dict
        -_state_history: Dict
        -_performance_metrics: Dict
        +track_widget(widget)
        +get_widget_info(widget)
        +print_widget_state(widget)
        +watch_widget(widget, interval)
    }

    class WidgetInspector {
        <<static>>
        +inspect(widget): Dict
        +validate_state(widget): List
        +compare_widgets(w1, w2): Dict
    }
```

Features:
- **State History**: Track all state transitions
- **Performance Metrics**: Initialization timing, error counts
- **Live Watching**: Monitor widget state in real-time
- **State Validation**: Detect inconsistencies
- **Widget Comparison**: Debug differences between widgets

## Design Principles

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
All state changes and interactions are event-driven through Qt signals, eliminating timing dependencies and race conditions.

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**
- **AppWidget**: Manages its own lifecycle and state
- **SignalManager**: Handles connection lifecycle
- **SplitPaneWidget**: Manages layout and widget coordination
- **WidgetState**: Encapsulates state definitions and validation

### 3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**
- Invalid state transitions are prevented
- Focus requests on non-ready widgets are queued
- Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Error recovery with backoff prevents infinite loops

### 4. **Extensibility**
The template method pattern allows new widget types to customize behavior without modifying the core lifecycle management.

## Integration Points

### With Split Pane System

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[User Action: Split Pane] --> B[WorkspaceService]
    B --> C[SplitPaneWidget.split_horizontal]
    C --> D[Create New AppWidget]
    D --> E{Widget Type}
    E -->|Async| F[Connect to widget_ready]
    E -->|Sync| G[Focus Immediately]
    F --> H[Wait for Ready Signal]
    H --> I[Focus on Ready]
```

### With Command System

Commands interact with widgets through their lifecycle-aware methods:
- Commands check widget state before operations
- Commands can wait for widget readiness
- Commands trigger proper cleanup through lifecycle methods
