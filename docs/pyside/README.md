# PySide6/Qt6 Development Documentation

This directory contains practical guides and documentation for developing GUI applications with PySide6/Qt6. These documents are based on real-world implementation experience and cover common challenges developers face when building modern desktop applications.

## Available Guides

### ðŸ“– [Custom Frameless Windows](CustomFramelessWindows.md)
**Complete guide for implementing frameless windows with cross-platform support**

Learn how to create modern, custom-styled windows that work reliably across Windows, macOS, and Linux (including Wayland). This comprehensive guide covers:

- **Platform considerations** - Understanding Wayland restrictions and solutions
- **Complete implementation** - Full working code for frameless windows with custom title bars
- **Edge detection and resizing** - Implementing resize borders with visual feedback
- **Window controls** - Custom minimize, maximize, and close buttons
- **Menu bar integration** - Handling native menus in frameless mode
- **Testing strategies** - Automated testing patterns and common test cases
- **Common pitfalls** - Quick reference table for debugging issues
- **Best practices** - Guidelines based on production experience

*Perfect for: Developers wanting to maximize screen real estate, create branded experiences, or implement modern UI patterns like Chrome-style tabs.*

### ðŸ“¦ [Building Executables](BuildingExecutables.md)
**Comprehensive guide to deploying PySide6 applications as standalone executables**

Learn how to use `pyside6-deploy` to create production-ready executables that work across Windows, macOS, and Linux. This guide covers everything from basic deployment to advanced optimization:

- **Quick start** - Deploy your first app in minutes
- **Configuration mastery** - Understanding and customizing pysidedeploy.spec
- **Size optimization** - Techniques to reduce executable size by 50-70%
- **Platform specifics** - Windows code signing, macOS notarization, Linux AppImage
- **Performance tuning** - Startup time optimization and resource handling
- **Troubleshooting** - Solutions to common deployment issues
- **Tool comparison** - pyside6-deploy vs PyInstaller vs manual Nuitka
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated builds with GitHub Actions

*Perfect for: Developers ready to distribute their PySide6 applications, teams setting up automated build pipelines, or anyone wanting smaller, faster executables than PyInstaller provides.*

## Guide Structure

Each document in this collection follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - What the guide covers and why it's important
2. **Platform Considerations** - OS-specific behavior and limitations
3. **Complete Implementation** - Full working code examples
4. **Edge Cases** - Real-world problems and their solutions
5. **Testing** - How to test the implementation
6. **Best Practices** - Recommendations from experience
7. **Common Pitfalls** - Things to watch out for

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:

1. **Be practical** - Base guides on actual implementation experience
2. **Be complete** - Include full working examples, not just snippets
3. **Be generic** - Make guides reusable for any PySide6 project
4. **Include tests** - Show how to test the implementation
5. **Document pitfalls** - Share what went wrong and how to fix it

## Prerequisites

These guides assume:
- PySide6 6.5+ or Qt6 equivalent
- Python 3.8+
- Basic familiarity with Qt concepts (signals/slots, widgets, layouts)

## Platform Testing

Code in these guides has been tested on:
- **Windows 11** - Native
- **macOS** - 12+ (Monterey and later)
- **Linux** - Ubuntu 22.04+ with both X11 and Wayland

## Quick Tips

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install PySide6
pip install PySide6

# For development
pip install pytest pytest-qt  # Testing
pip install black ruff mypy   # Code quality
```

### Testing on Wayland
```bash
# Force Wayland backend
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland

# Force X11 backend (for comparison)
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb
```

### Debug Mode
```python
# Enable Qt debug output
import os
os.environ['QT_LOGGING_RULES'] = '*.debug=true'
```
