# Phase 2 Unit Test Fix - Progress Report

## Date: 2025-09-12

## Objective
Fix failing unit tests to match current implementation after completing Phase 1 (all tests now import successfully).

## Completed Actions in Phase 2

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed test_split_pane_model.py
Major refactoring to match the actual implementation:

#### Key Changes Made:
- **Attribute Names**: Fixed all attribute names
  - `node_id` ‚Üí `id`
  - `node_type` ‚Üí `type`
  - `"pane"` ‚Üí `"leaf"`
  
- **Data Structure**: Updated for dataclass-based nodes
  - Removed `children` list references
  - Changed to `first`/`second` attributes for SplitNode
  - Fixed orientation values: `Qt.Horizontal` ‚Üí `"horizontal"`
  
- **API Methods**: Updated all method calls
  - `split_node()` ‚Üí `split_pane()`
  - `remove_node()` ‚Üí `close_pane()`
  - `get_all_panes()` ‚Üí accessing `leaves` dict
  - Added `qtbot` fixture to all test methods

#### Test Results:
- 9/9 basic node tests now pass
- Model tests require QApplication (widgets created)
- Need to mock widget creation for pure model testing

### 2. üîÑ Analyzed test_split_pane_widget.py
Discovered fundamental architecture change:
- PaneContent now requires `LeafNode` argument
- Complete MVC separation implemented
- View layer (PaneContent) doesn't own widgets
- Model (LeafNode) owns AppWidgets

## Current Test Status

### Phase 2 Progress:
```
Fixed Files:
‚úÖ test_split_pane_model.py - Partially fixed (node tests pass)

Needs Major Rewrite:
‚ùå test_split_pane_widget.py - Architecture completely changed
‚ùå test_workspace.py - Needs update for new architecture
```

## Key Architectural Discoveries

### Old Architecture:
- PaneContent directly created and managed widgets
- TabWidget was part of PaneContent
- No clear model/view separation

### New Architecture:
- **Model Layer** (split_pane_model.py):
  - LeafNode owns AppWidget
  - SplitNode manages tree structure
  - SplitPaneModel orchestrates everything
  
- **View Layer** (split_pane_widget.py):
  - PaneContent is a thin wrapper
  - Requires LeafNode in constructor
  - Doesn't own widgets, just displays them

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Widget Creation in Tests**: 
   - Model creates actual Qt widgets
   - Tests fail without QApplication
   - Need mocking strategy for widget creation

2. **Complete API Change**:
   - Most method signatures changed
   - Different object relationships
   - Need to understand new architecture fully

3. **MVC Separation**:
   - Tests assumed old monolithic structure
   - New tests need to respect MVC boundaries
   - May need separate model and view tests

## Recommendations for Continuing Phase 2

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Mock Widget Creation**: Create mock for `create_app_widget()` method
2. **Rewrite PaneContent Tests**: Complete rewrite for new constructor signature
3. **Fix SplitPaneWidget Tests**: Update for new architecture

### Test Strategy Changes:
1. **Separate Concerns**:
   - Pure model tests (no Qt widgets)
   - View tests (with qtbot)
   - Integration tests (full stack)

2. **Mock Strategy**:
   - Mock AppWidget creation in model tests
   - Use real widgets only in integration tests

## Files Modified in Phase 2

### Modified:
- `/tests/unit/test_split_pane_model.py` - Major updates for new API

### Created:
- `/docs/testing/PHASE2_UNIT_TEST_PROGRESS.md` - This report

## Summary

Phase 2 has made significant progress understanding the new architecture and fixing the split_pane_model tests. However, the architecture changes are more extensive than initially anticipated, requiring a complete rewrite of many tests rather than simple fixes.

The main challenge is that the new MVC architecture fundamentally changes how components interact. Tests written for the old monolithic structure cannot be easily adapted and need complete rewrites.

## Estimated Remaining Work

- **test_split_pane_widget.py**: 2-3 hours (complete rewrite)
- **test_workspace.py**: 1-2 hours (significant updates)
- **Mocking strategy**: 1 hour (implement and test)
- **Other failing tests**: 3-4 hours (various fixes)

Total estimated time to complete Phase 2: 7-10 hours of focused work.
