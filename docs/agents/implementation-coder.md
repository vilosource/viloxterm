# Implementation Coder Agent

## Purpose
An agent that can properly implement features from design documents while respecting existing architecture, preventing breaking changes, and maintaining code quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Understand Before Acting
- **NEVER** write code without reading existing implementations
- **ALWAYS** verify assumptions about class structures, inheritance patterns, and APIs
- **DOCUMENT** understanding before implementation

### 2. Incremental Development
- Write maximum 10 lines before testing
- Each step must leave the application in a working state
- Commit working increments frequently

### 3. Architecture Alignment
- Respect existing patterns and conventions
- Suggest improvements when architecture is problematic
- Never break backward compatibility without explicit approval

## Agent Protocol

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (MANDATORY)
```yaml
steps:
  1. Read design document:
     - Extract requirements
     - Identify success criteria
     - Note any ambiguities
  
  2. Map existing codebase:
     - Find related files
     - Understand current architecture
     - Identify patterns in use
  
  3. Verify assumptions:
     - Check class structures (inheritance vs composition)
     - Verify import paths
     - Understand data flow
  
  4. Create implementation plan:
     - Break into testable increments
     - Identify risks
     - Plan rollback points
```

### Phase 2: Pre-Implementation Verification
```yaml
checks:
  - Can the app start? (python main.py)
  - Are there existing tests? (pytest)
  - What are the critical paths?
  - What could break?
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Protocol
```yaml
for each increment:
  1. Write stub (< 10 lines)
  2. Verify syntax (python -m py_compile)
  3. Test app starts (python main.py)
  4. Implement logic
  5. Test functionality
  6. Commit if working
  7. Document what was done
```

### Phase 4: Validation
```yaml
validation:
  - All original functionality still works
  - New functionality matches design
  - No import errors
  - No type errors
  - Tests pass
```

## Context Requirements

The agent needs access to:

### 1. Design Documents
- Feature specifications
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- API contracts
- UI/UX requirements

### 2. Codebase Knowledge
- File structure and organization
- Naming conventions
- Import patterns
- Testing approach

### 3. Project State
- Current working branch
- Recent changes
- Known issues
- Development guidelines

## Agent Queries

### Before Writing Any Code
```python
# The agent MUST answer these questions:
questions = {
    "class_structure": "Is this a @dataclass, regular class, or base class?",
    "import_paths": "What is the exact import path?",
    "existing_patterns": "How are similar features implemented?",
    "dependencies": "What will be affected by this change?",
    "testing": "How do I test this?",
}
```

### Before Using Any Class
```bash
# Agent must run these checks:
grep -n "class ClassName" path/to/file.py  # Check structure
grep -r "from .* import ClassName"         # Check usage patterns
grep -r "ClassName("                        # Check instantiation
```

### Before Extending/Inheriting
```python
# Agent must verify:
checks = [
    "Is inheritance used elsewhere in codebase?",
    "Is this a dataclass or regular class?",
    "Does it have __init__ or use fields?",
    "What's the initialization pattern?",
]
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Function Handlers (Preferred)
```python
# For command-like functionality
def feature_handler(context: Context) -> Result:
    """Implementation here."""
    return Result(success=True)

# Register it
registry.register(Command(
    id="feature.action",
    handler=feature_handler
))
```

### Pattern 2: Service Classes
```python
# For stateful services
class FeatureService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
    
    def perform_action(self, params):
        # Implementation
        return result

# Register with ServiceLocator
ServiceLocator.register("feature_service", FeatureService())
```

### Pattern 3: UI Components
```python
# For Qt widgets
class FeatureWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self._setup_ui()
    
    def _setup_ui(self):
        # UI setup
        pass
```

## Error Prevention Strategies

### 1. Import Verification
```python
# Before using any import:
try:
    from module.path import Thing
    print(f"✓ Import verified: {Thing}")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"✗ Import failed: {e}")
    # STOP - Fix import first
```

### 2. Type Checking
```python
# Before assuming structure:
import inspect

if inspect.isclass(Thing):
    if hasattr(Thing, '__dataclass_fields__'):
        print("It's a dataclass")
    else:
        print("It's a regular class")
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
```python
# Start with minimal implementation:
def feature_v1():
    return "stub"

# Test it works, then enhance:
def feature_v2():
    return actual_implementation()
```

## Testing Protocol

### Level 1: Smoke Test (MANDATORY)
```python
def smoke_test():
    """Can the app start?"""
    try:
        from ui.main_window import MainWindow
        print("✓ App can initialize")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ App broken: {e}")
        return False
```

### Level 2: Feature Test
```python
def feature_test():
    """Does the feature work?"""
    try:
        result = new_feature()
        assert result.success
        print("✓ Feature works")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Feature broken: {e}")
        return False
```

### Level 3: Integration Test
```python
def integration_test():
    """Does it work with existing code?"""
    # Test interactions with other components
    pass
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Checkpoint System
```bash
# Before starting work
git checkout -b feature/safe-implementation
git tag checkpoint-0

# After each working increment
git commit -am "WIP: Feature works at level X"
git tag checkpoint-1

# If something breaks
git reset --hard checkpoint-1
```

## Agent Instructions Template

When implementing a feature, the agent should follow this template:

```markdown
## Implementation Task: [Feature Name]

### 1. Understanding Phase
- [ ] Read design document
- [ ] Located relevant files: [list files]
- [ ] Verified class structures
- [ ] Checked import paths
- [ ] Identified patterns

### 2. Implementation Plan
Step 1: [Description] (5 lines)
Step 2: [Description] (8 lines)
Step 3: [Description] (10 lines)

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Could break: [list]
- Dependencies: [list]
- Rollback plan: [description]

### 4. Execution
[Document each step as completed]

### 5. Validation
- [ ] App starts
- [ ] Feature works
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No regressions
```

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

### Agent Roles
1. **Analyzer Agent**: Understands codebase and patterns
2. **Implementer Agent**: Writes code following patterns
3. **Tester Agent**: Validates implementation
4. **Reviewer Agent**: Checks for issues

### Context Passing
```yaml
context:
  from_analyzer:
    - file_structure
    - patterns_found
    - class_types
    - import_paths
  
  to_implementer:
    - verified_patterns
    - safe_approaches
    - testing_commands
  
  to_tester:
    - changes_made
    - test_commands
    - expected_behavior
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Assumption-Based Coding
```python
# BAD - Assuming inheritance
class NewFeature(SomeClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # Could fail!

# GOOD - Verify first
# Check: Is SomeClass a base class or dataclass?
# Then implement accordingly
```

### 2. Import Path Guessing
```python
# BAD - Guessing import
from core.services.thing import Thing

# GOOD - Verify first
# Run: find . -name "*.py" | xargs grep "class Thing"
# Use actual path found
```

### 3. Big Bang Changes
```python
# BAD - 500 lines at once
[massive implementation]

# GOOD - Incremental
# Step 1: Stub (test)
# Step 2: Basic feature (test)
# Step 3: Enhancement (test)
```

## Success Metrics

The agent implementation is successful if:
1. **Zero broken commits** - Every commit has working app
2. **Incremental delivery** - Features added in stages
3. **No assumptions** - Everything verified
4. **Tests pass** - At least smoke tests
5. **Documentation accurate** - Implementation matches design

## Agent Prompt Template

```
You are an Implementation Coder Agent for the viloapp project.

Your task is to implement [FEATURE] from [DESIGN_DOCUMENT].

MANDATORY PROTOCOL:
1. Read and understand existing code before writing
2. Verify all assumptions about classes and imports
3. Implement in increments of max 10 lines
4. Test after every increment
5. Commit only working code

CONTEXT PROVIDED:
- Design: [path/to/design.md]
- Related files: [list]
- Current branch: [branch]
- App starts: [yes/no]

BEFORE WRITING CODE:
- What type is each class? (regular/dataclass/base)
- What are the exact import paths?
- How are similar features implemented?
- What could break?

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
[Describe incremental plan]

Begin implementation following the protocol.
```

## Integration with Claude Code

### Command to Invoke
```bash
# User command:
"Implement [feature] from [design] using safe-coder agent"

# Agent responds with:
1. Context gathering results
2. Implementation plan
3. Risk assessment
4. Incremental implementation
5. Test results
```

### Agent Configuration
```python
agent_config = {
    "name": "safe-implementation-coder",
    "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep"],
    "protocol": "incremental-tested",
    "max_lines_per_step": 10,
    "test_required": True,
    "commit_working_only": True,
}
```

## Conclusion

This agent design prioritizes **correctness over speed** and **working code over complete features**. By enforcing verification, incremental development, and continuous testing, it prevents the cascade failures we experienced.

The key insight: An agent that takes 2 hours to deliver working code is infinitely more valuable than one that takes 30 minutes to deliver broken code that requires 3 hours to fix.
