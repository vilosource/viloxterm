# Agent Usage Log

## 2025-09-11: Tab & Pane Naming Feature

### Setup Phase
- **Branch:** `feature/tab-pane-naming`
- **Design:** `docs/features/TAB_PANE_NAMING_DESIGN.md`
- **Agent Approach:** Safe Implementation with Anti-Drift Protocol

### Anti-Drift Mechanisms Applied

1. **Design Lock File** (`.design-lock.yml`)
   - Immutable requirements (REQ001-REQ006)
   - Clear invariants (what must not change)
   - Success criteria (what done looks like)
   - Red flags (stop if you see these)

2. **Implementation Context** (`.implementation-context.md`)
   - North Star reminder (original goal)
   - Incremental plan (5 phases)
   - Key constraints (DO NOT violate)
   - Validation commands

3. **Incremental Development Plan**
   ```
   Phase 1: Infrastructure (name fields, widget)
   Phase 2: Tab Renaming (double-click, F2)
   Phase 3: Pane Renaming (right-click menu)
   Phase 4: Persistence (StateService)
   Phase 5: Polish (visual distinction)
   ```

### Key Principles Being Followed

1. **No Big Bang Changes** - 5 small phases instead of one large change
2. **Continuous Validation** - Test after each increment
3. **Pattern Respect** - Using existing StateService and command patterns
4. **Architecture Preservation** - Not modifying core models
5. **Context Persistence** - Tracking progress in `.implementation-context.md`

### Next Steps

When implementing, the agent will:
1. Read both lock file and context before each step
2. Implement maximum 10 lines at a time
3. Validate app still starts after each change
4. Update context file with progress
5. Stop immediately if any red flag is encountered

### Expected Outcomes

- No drift from original design
- Working application at each step
- Clean implementation following patterns
- Full test coverage
- No architectural violations

This approach demonstrates the practical application of our anti-drift agent design.
