# Agent Usage Log

## 2025-09-11: Tab & Pane Naming Feature

### Setup Phase
- **Branch:** `feature/tab-pane-naming`
- **Design:** `docs/features/TAB_PANE_NAMING_DESIGN.md`
- **Agent Approach:** Safe Implementation with Anti-Drift Protocol

### Anti-Drift Mechanisms Applied

1. **Design Lock File** (`.design-lock.yml`)
   - Immutable requirements (REQ001-REQ006)
   - Clear invariants (what must not change)
   - Success criteria (what done looks like)
   - Red flags (stop if you see these)

2. **Implementation Context** (`.implementation-context.md`)
   - North Star reminder (original goal)
   - Incremental plan (5 phases)
   - Key constraints (DO NOT violate)
   - Validation commands

3. **Incremental Development Plan**
   ```
   Phase 1: Infrastructure (name fields, widget)
   Phase 2: Tab Renaming (double-click, F2)
   Phase 3: Pane Renaming (right-click menu)
   Phase 4: Persistence (StateService)
   Phase 5: Polish (visual distinction)
   ```

### Key Principles Being Followed

1. **No Big Bang Changes** - 5 small phases instead of one large change
2. **Continuous Validation** - Test after each increment
3. **Pattern Respect** - Using existing StateService and command patterns
4. **Architecture Preservation** - Not modifying core models
5. **Context Persistence** - Tracking progress in `.implementation-context.md`

### Next Steps

When implementing, the agent will:
1. Read both lock file and context before each step
2. Implement maximum 10 lines at a time
3. Validate app still starts after each change
4. Update context file with progress
5. Stop immediately if any red flag is encountered

### Expected Outcomes

- No drift from original design
- Working application at each step
- Clean implementation following patterns
- Full test coverage
- No architectural violations

This approach demonstrates the practical application of our anti-drift agent design.

## 2025-09-11: Tab Renaming Implementation (Code Monkey Success)

### Implementation Results

**Agent Used:** Code Monkey
**Feature:** Tab renaming functionality  
**Result:** âœ… Successfully implemented without breaking existing code

### Key Discoveries

1. **Existing Infrastructure Found**
   - Discovered `RenameEditor` class already existed in codebase
   - Avoided duplicating functionality by reusing existing component
   - Pattern: Always search for existing UI components before creating new ones

2. **Architecture Insights**
   - Tab system uses `WorkspaceTab` object with `.name` property
   - Both visual text and internal state need updating
   - Qt's `tabRect()` method provides exact positioning for overlays

3. **Successful Patterns Applied**
   - Made changes in 10-line increments
   - Tested app startup after each change
   - Used existing signal/slot patterns for event handling
   - Followed existing context menu structure

### What Code Monkey Prevented

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: App never failed to start during implementation
- **No Duplicate Code**: Reused existing `RenameEditor` instead of creating new
- **No Architecture Violations**: Followed existing patterns exactly
- **No Assumptions**: Verified `WorkspaceTab.name` structure before using

### Learnings for Future Agents

1. **Discovery Phase is Critical**
   - Always search for existing components (especially UI widgets)
   - Check for helper classes before implementing from scratch
   - Use grep/glob to find patterns like `class.*Editor`, `class.*Dialog`

2. **Incremental Testing Works**
   - 10-line rule prevented all breaking changes
   - `test_app_starts.sh` script proved invaluable
   - Quick feedback loop caught issues immediately

3. **Pattern Recognition Pays Off**
   - Following existing patterns (context menus, signals) ensured consistency
   - Reading surrounding code revealed correct approaches
   - No need to reinvent solutions that already exist

### Recommended Agent Improvements

Based on this success, consider adding to Code Monkey:
- Pre-implementation discovery checklist for UI components
- Pattern catalog of common reusable components
- Success metrics tracking (components discovered vs created)
