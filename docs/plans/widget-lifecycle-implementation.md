## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive widget lifecycle management system to fix focus issues, improve performance, and provide a robust foundation for all AppWidget types in ViloxTerm.

**Primary Goal**: Fix the immediate focus issue when splitting panes while establishing a scalable architecture for widget lifecycle management.

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for complete implementation

## Problem Statement

When users split a pane (Ctrl+\), the new pane's terminal widget doesn't receive focus because:
1. Focus is attempted before the terminal content is loaded
2. No mechanism exists to track widget readiness
3. Arbitrary timer delays are unreliable

This is part of larger architectural issues:
- No widget lifecycle state management
- Signal connections not properly managed
- Widget pool not utilized for AppWidgets
- No error recovery mechanisms

## Appendix

### A. Code Examples

#### Example: Using New Widget Lifecycle
```python
class MyCustomWidget(AppWidget):
    def __init__(self, widget_id: str):
        super().__init__(widget_id, WidgetType.CUSTOM)
        self.initialize()

    def initialize(self):
        super().initialize()
        # Start async loading
        self.load_content()

    def load_content(self):
        # Simulate async load
        QTimer.singleShot(1000, self.content_loaded)

    def content_loaded(self):
        # Mark as ready
        self.set_ready()

    def on_suspend(self):
        # Pause expensive operations
        self.stop_animations()

    def on_resume(self):
        # Resume operations
        self.start_animations()
```

### B. Testing Checklist

- [x] Unit tests for each new class
- [x] Integration tests for widget interactions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [x] Memory leak tests (SignalManager prevents leaks)
- [x] Focus behavior tests (explicit tracking, queue mechanism)
- [x] Error recovery tests (configurable retry strategy)
- [x] Signal cleanup tests (automatic via SignalManager)
- [ ] Pool efficiency tests (not implemented yet)

### C. Migration Guide for Existing Widgets

1. Inherit from updated AppWidget
2. Call `initialize()` in constructor
3. Call `set_ready()` when fully loaded
4. Implement lifecycle hooks as needed
5. Use SignalManager for connections
6. Test thoroughly

### D. Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Diagnosis | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Widget doesn't get focus | Check widget_state | Ensure set_ready() is called |
| Memory leak | Check signal connections | Use SignalManager |
| Slow initialization | Profile initialization | Consider pooling |
| State transition error | Check logs | Fix state machine logic |
