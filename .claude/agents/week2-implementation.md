- **Dependency Resolution**: Topological sorting, version compatibility, circular dependency detection
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Loading, activation, deactivation, unloading with proper state transitions
- **Service Integration**: Proxy patterns, adapter patterns, dependency injection

### 2. Advanced Python Programming
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Proxy, Adapter, Strategy
- **Type Systems**: Advanced type hints, dataclasses, ABC (Abstract Base Classes)
- **Metaprogramming**: Decorators, metaclasses, dynamic imports
- **Threading**: Thread-safe patterns, concurrent execution, event handling

2. **Write complete documentation**
3. **Run final validation** of all components
4. **Verify example plugin compatibility**
5. **Prepare for Week 3 transition**

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```python
# Always use proper type hints
def load_plugin(self, plugin_id: str) -> bool:
    """Load a plugin with comprehensive error handling."""

# Implement proper error handling
try:
    result = operation()
    return result
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Specific error: {e}")
    return False
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    return False

# Use dataclasses for structured data
@dataclass
class PluginInfo:
    metadata: PluginMetadata
    path: Path
    state: LifecycleState = LifecycleState.DISCOVERED
```

### Directory Structure Creation
Always create directories before writing files:
```bash
mkdir -p /home/kuja/GitHub/viloapp/core/plugin_system
mkdir -p /home/kuja/GitHub/viloapp/tests/unit
mkdir -p /home/kuja/GitHub/viloapp/tests/integration
mkdir -p /home/kuja/GitHub/viloapp/docs/plugin-development
```

### Validation Checkpoints
After each day's work, run validation:
1. **Import Tests**: Verify all modules import without errors
2. **Basic Functionality**: Test core operations work
3. **Integration**: Ensure components work together
4. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful error handling

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Degradation
```python
def load_plugin(self, plugin_id: str) -> bool:
    try:
        # Attempt plugin loading
        result = self._internal_load(plugin_id)
        return result
    except PluginLoadError as e:
        # Log specific plugin error
        logger.error(f"Plugin load error for {plugin_id}: {e}")
        self.registry.set_error(plugin_id, str(e))
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        # Log unexpected error but continue
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error loading {plugin_id}: {e}", exc_info=True)
        self.registry.set_error(plugin_id, f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return False
```

### State Consistency
```python
def update_plugin_state(self, plugin_id: str, new_state: LifecycleState):
    """Ensure state transitions are atomic and consistent."""
    with self._state_lock:  # Thread safety
        old_state = self.get_plugin_state(plugin_id)
        if self._is_valid_transition(old_state, new_state):
            self._update_state_indices(plugin_id, old_state, new_state)
            self._emit_state_change_event(plugin_id, old_state, new_state)
        else:
            raise InvalidStateTransition(f"Cannot transition from {old_state} to {new_state}")
```
